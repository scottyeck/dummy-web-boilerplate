# dummy web boilerplate

This is a dummy web boilerplate used for testing / teaching / examples. The goal of this boilerplate is to be able to spin up any example in less than 30 seconds without wasting time creating the same file structures over and over again.

Included are:

* `index.html` - Empty indexfile
* `styles.css` - Empty stylesheet, referenced in index
* `main.js` - Empty JS file, also referenced in index
